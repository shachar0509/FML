# Decisions (where the spec was silent)

- TypeScript pinned to 5.9 (spec says TS 5; typescript-eslint does not support 7 yet).
- Toasts use a small own zustand store instead of sonner.
- Settings persist via plugin-store inside Tauri, localStorage in a plain browser (dev/tests).
- Until onboarding is completed every route redirects to /onboarding.
- Bundle targets include "app" so the dmg can be built on macOS.
